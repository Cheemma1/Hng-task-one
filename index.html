        <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
        <p>
          In the next two years, I aim to achieve the following goals in my tech
          career:
        </p>

        <ul class="goal-list">
          <li>
            <b>Frontend Development: </b> I plan to become an expert in frontend
            development by mastering advanced concepts and technologies. This
            includes deepening my knowledge of frameworks like React and
            Angular, improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
            staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Learning Cloud Computing: </b> I intend to dive into cloud
            computing to broaden my technical skill set. This will involve
            gaining proficiency in platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google
            Cloud, understanding how to deploy and manage applications in the
            cloud, and exploring the benefits of serverless architecture and
            cloud-based services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Professional Experience: </b> I aspire to work in a reputable
            tech firm as a frontend developer. This experience will provide me
            with the opportunity to collaborate with talented professionals,
            work on challenging projects, and contribute to the development of
            innovative web applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Public Speaking and Community Involvement: </b> I aim to become a
            speaker at various tech events, sharing my knowledge and experiences
            with the community. This includes participating in conferences,
            webinars, and meetups to discuss frontend technologies, best
            practices, and industry trends. Engaging with the tech community
            will help me grow as a professional and stay connected with
            like-minded individuals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By focusing on these goals, I am confident that I will be able to
          advance my career, make meaningful contributions to the tech industry,
          and continuously improve my skills and knowledge.
